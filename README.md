This project is a mobile app that displays my Slack identity and profile photo, putting a face to the name and creating a more personal relationship.

 there is more! What distinguishes this app is its handy "Open GitHub" button. Thanks to a WebView component that smoothly redirects you, you can see my GitHub profile immediately within the app with a single tap. This feature allows you to easily browse my projects, contributions, and repositories without leaving the application, making it easier to get to know me and my work.
